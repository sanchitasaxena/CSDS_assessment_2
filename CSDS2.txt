Recursion Questions:

1. Recursion is when a function calls itself - it calls itself while it's
defining itself. The same thing keeps happening after the base case is completed;
the same thing keeps happening until every single iteration is completed. 

2. A base case is necessary because it's a question that you know the answer to.


Graphs:

1. Store objects and their attributes and show relationships/connections 
with other nodes, whether they are direct or not. 
2. Graphs are different than trees because they contain loops.
3. A process is good to model with a graph because you can show how each step is
and will be related to the next. Sometimes, step cannot exist without another so
dependencies can also be represented well.

Sorting:

1. Bubble Sort - classic sorting algorithm, where the largest # floats to the top/
end of the list.
2. Merge Sort - a super clever and fast that uses recursion, so it compares each adjacent elements and sorts them, and it keeps doing it until it reaches len(list) -1 element.
3. Quick Sort - fastest sorting algorithm, where you pick a pivot, and using recursion you divide and conquer.


Git Branching:

1. For my project, if I wanna test an idea I can use git branching so I don't 
screw up any of my already working code.
2. A pull request is when you ask the owner of the repo to check your branch out and merge
it to the master branch. It's a way to contribute code.
